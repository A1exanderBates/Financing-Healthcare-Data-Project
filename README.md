## Technologies Used
## ETL Processes and Data Modeling
## Future Improvements

There are three main future improvements I plan to tackle over the coming weeks. 

A. Testing and Data Quality Tests

I plan to ehance the data ingestion pipeline and dbt workflow by incorporating tests throughout. Some of these tests will include:
* NULL values tests
* Volume tests
* Accepted range/numeric distribution tests
* Source freshness checks

B. Performance and Optimization

C. An Analysis Component and/or Tableau Visualization
