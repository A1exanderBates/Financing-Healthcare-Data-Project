### About the Dataset
### Technologies Used
### ETL Processes and Data Modeling
### Future Improvements

There are three main future improvements I plan to tackle over the coming weeks. 

A. Testing and Data Quality Tests

Testing and data quality checks are paramount in data engineering because they ensure the reliability and accuracy of data pipelines. As businesses increasingly rely on data-driven decisions, even minor errors in data processing can lead to significant misinterpretations, resulting in flawed business strategies. By implementing robust testing and quality checks, data engineers can identify and rectify inconsistencies, missing values, or anomalies early in the pipeline, guaranteeing that end users receive trustworthy and high-caliber data for their analytics and operational needs.

I plan to ehance the data ingestion pipeline and dbt workflow by incorporating tests throughout. Some of these tests will include:
* NULL values tests
* Volume tests
* Accepted range/numeric distribution tests
* Source freshness checks

B. Performance and Optimization

Refactoring data pipelines for performance and optimization is vital in data engineering to handle growing data volumes efficiently and to ensure that data is available for analysis in near real-time. By streamlining and enhancing these pipelines, data engineers can reduce latency, minimize resource consumption, and provide more reliable data delivery, enabling businesses to derive insights faster and make informed decisions promptly.

C. An Analysis Component and/or Tableau Visualization

Incorporating an analysis component or a Tableau data visualization in a data engineering project illuminates the value and potential of the data being processed, offering stakeholders tangible insights and a visual representation of their data's story. This not only validates the integrity and efficacy of the engineered pipelines but also empowers decision-makers with accessible, actionable intelligence, bridging the gap between raw data and meaningful business strategy.
